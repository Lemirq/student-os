Introduction to Programming
---------------------------

Today we learned about the basics of programming. Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.

Key Concepts:
- Variables: Containers for storing data values
- Data Types: Different kinds of values (numbers, text, booleans)
- Operators: Symbols that perform operations on variables and values

Data Types Explained:
1. Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, 10, -3)
2. Float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
3. String: Text values (e.g., "Hello", "World")
4. Boolean: True or false values

Variables in Practice:
  x = 10           // Assign value 10 to variable x
  name = "Alice"   // Assign text to variable name
  is_valid = true  // Assign boolean value

Operators:
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Comparison: ==, !=, <, >
- Logical: AND, OR, NOT

Homework Assignment:
Complete exercises 1-10 from Chapter 2 of the textbook. Submit by Friday at 5 PM.

Remember to practice daily! Programming skills improve with consistent practice.
